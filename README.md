# SORTING-VISUALIZER



This project is a web application designed to visually demonstrate and compare various classic sorting algorithms. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this interactive tool provides an intuitive way to understand and observe how algorithms like bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, and quicksort function.

The primary aim of this project is to make sorting algorithms more accessible and engaging for developers, computer science students, and anyone interested in understanding how these fundamental algorithms work. By presenting the sorting process visually, users can observe step-by-step iterations, track element movements, and gain insights into algorithmic complexities.

Key features of this web application include:

1. Interactive Visualization: The sorting algorithms are visually represented through animations, allowing users to see how elements are compared, swapped, and repositioned during the sorting process. The visualizations provide a clear representation of how different algorithms approach sorting and their varying efficiencies.

2. Algorithm Selection: Users can choose among several classic sorting algorithms to visualize, including bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, and quicksort. This selection empowers users to compare and contrast the performance characteristics of each algorithm.

3. Adjustable Speed and Array Size: The application allows users to control the speed of the visualization, enabling them to observe sorting in real-time or in slow motion. Additionally, users can adjust the size of the input array to witness how algorithms handle different amounts of data.

4. Step-by-Step Mode: For users who prefer a more detailed breakdown, a step-by-step mode is available. This mode provides a granular view of each iteration and allows users to understand the algorithmic process at a slower pace.

5. Responsive Design: The web application is designed to be responsive and accessible across various devices and screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience on desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

This GitHub project serves as a valuable learning resource, fostering a deeper understanding of sorting algorithms through interactive visualization. It encourages experimentation, algorithmic exploration, and the development of optimized sorting solutions. Whether you're a novice programmer or an experienced developer, this web application is an excellent tool for enhancing your understanding of sorting algorithms and their performance characteristics.
